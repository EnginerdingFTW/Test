      The overall concept of the game is the archer was the royal knight of the King and Queen of a kingdom. A dragon attacks and
      kills the king. The queen, wanting revenge, sends her loyal knight, archer dude, to get her revenge and also defend the kingdom.
    
    Gameplay:
      You are an archer trying to kill the dragon as fast as possible so you tend to never stop running. You must shoot
      any enemies that come between you and the dragon and also use your arrows to solve puzzles that may block your path.
    
  About the Makers and our experience:
    Archer Dude is an app in development for IOS and Android by a team of 2 people, Michael Parr (my roomate) and I.
    We both are programmers (Me - Computer Engineering, him - Computer Science) with no experience in art. For this app 
    we created all the art in "Gimp" with the style of pixel art (we thought this would be easiest for us since we had no
    experience drawing).
